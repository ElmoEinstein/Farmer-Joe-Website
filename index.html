        Farmer Joe is a extended version off a game I made for a Game Jam. I worked on it for around 9 months but probably won't continue as I lost passion for the project and some features are buggy because I was new to Unity upon creating the game.
        <br><br>
        <h3>Game Jam Version</h3>
        Farmer Joe was originally created for the Ludum Dare 52 game jam as a project with my friend. It is a game about a farmer trying to make as much money as possible in a short amount off time. The game did pretty well so I decided to keep on 
        working on it but sadly my friend did not share my passion.<br><br>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        I continued to work on the game, adding a picking up and placing system:<br><br>

        <br><br> A car for map selection:<br><br>
        <video controls><source src="/assets/CarRecording-D5fm1FNs.mp4"></video><br><br>
        and many more features such as an improved UI, opening cutscene, main menu, random card drawing system and many other features. Heres a video off a short demo off everything in the game.<br><br>

        Game Jams are game making competitions held online for game developers to test their skills in a time limit (usually 2-3 days).
        These competitions have been a massive part of my game development and multimedia journey, growing my skills substantially over a very short amount of time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Ludum Dare 51</h3>
        I mostly participate in a specific Game Jam called Ludum Dare, which is a 3 day competition and one of the most popular Game Jams with roughly 2000 participants each competition. 
        The first game I made for Ludum Dare was called <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/an-elephant-and-some-racoons">A Messed Up Elephant And Some Mean Racoons</a>. 
        It wasn't very good, had many bugs, was glitchy and overall wasn't fun but nevertheless, I was still pround of it. <br><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/51/an-elephant-and-some-racoons"><img src = "/assets/racoon-B_3FI6Rp.png"></a><br> 

        <h3>Ludum Dare 52</h3>
        The next Game Jam I participated in, near the end of Year 9, was a Ludum Dare, in which me and a friend created a early version of 
        <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52/farmer-joe">Farmer Joe</a>. The game was about a farmer trying to make as much 
        money as possible in a set amount off time. I did all the programming and he did most of the art, we ended up placing in the top 15% of games.<br><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52/farmer-joe"><img src = "/assets/FarmerJoe-Cnrwux3A.png"></a>
        <br>
        <h3>Mini Jam 130</h3>
        After that, I decided to undertake my first none Ludum Dare game jam in the form of a Mini Jam, which is a 3 day Game Jam that occurs every 2 weeks. I worked with another random 
        game developer (in which I never spoke too) and I did the programming and some art, while he did majority off the art. The game was called <a href="https://elmoeinstein.itch.io/lunar-artillery">Lunar Artillery<a>
        and it was about destroying waves off aliens. While the game didn't turn out the best in its presentation, I was proud off myself for creating a fully functioning wave system and gun system in such a short amount off time.
        <br><a href="https://elmoeinstein.itch.io/lunar-artillery"><img src="/assets/MiniJam-DLog1ktV.png"></a><br>

        <h3>Ludum Dare 54</h3>
        The next Game Jam game I made solo, at the very start off year 10  was one that I was very pround off. It was an ant cononley simulator call <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/fun-ant-game">Fun Ant Game</a>, where you had to work on expanding and building a cononley with different resources, 
        while strategically placing your buildings to make the most off your resources. I managed to code a lot off systems in the short time limit, create my first ever music score and a lot off people ended up spending
        half an hour or more playing my game. <br><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/fun-ant-game"><img src="/assets/FunAntGame-CdspSCa6.png"></a>

        <h3>Boss Russ Game Jam</h3>
        Boss Rush Game Jam is a very long 30 day Game Jam where you have to create a boss rush based on a them. Sadly I only got a week into because off sudden commitments that appeared later on, but I was still very happy with some off the art and concepts I made. 
        My concept was that I was going to create a game about a dog with a katana (called <a href="https://x.com/FarmerJoeDev/status/1745080397958914051/photo/1">Katana Kenji</a>), fighting off enemies. I made a few level with concept art and most off the first boss (gameplay on my Twitter) and was really pround off all the art and animations
        I made.<br><a href="https://x.com/FarmerJoeDev/status/1745080397958914051/photo/1"><img src = "/assets/KatanaKenji-BVhPIDsK.png"></a>

        My name is Kasper and I am a Australian Game Developer born in 2008. My hobbies include activities such as Rock Climbing, going to the gym and of course Game Development. 
        <br><br>I started learning Game Development in 2021, right after COVID as I had always been interested in the industry. I worked on many different games and participated in lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam">game jams</a> online. 
        <br><br> Nearing early 2024, I decided I wanted to expand my knowledge on the multimedia industry and worked on growing my skillset. Whilst I already knew how to create pixel art and code in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity</a> and GameMaker,
         I still didn't have any knowledge in creating 3D models, music, photography and creating websites.
        <br><br>In early 2024, I learnt html and css near the middle of the year learnt Java Script using 3JS. Mid way through 2024 I also decided to take creating music more seriously, making songs in a synthwave style for 
        my games and school projects. I also picked up the basics of Blender to create the portfolio you are reading right now!
